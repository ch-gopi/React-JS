# Browser Support

By default, generated projects use [Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist)'s `defaults` option to identify target browsers. Additionally, the React and Angular apps include polyfills for modern language features to support older browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer 11). If supporting such browsers isn't a requirement, the polyfill dependencies and imports can be removed.
